  <h1> About Me </h1>

  <p> I am an experienced Quality Engineer with 5+ years in the Automotive and Robotics industry. I started out with a B.S. in Engineering Science and Mechanics, with a minor in National Security and Foreign Affairs from Virginia Tech,
     and have self taught myself various skills as needed for my postion. 
     I started as an intern with my current company and as different responsibilites were place on our team, 
     I took the initiative to learn skills such as software administration, programming in python, 
     developed cross tool automations, and data analysis. My personal brand is <em>"Let Me Try."</em>
      -- I am the individual who does not like to back down from a challenge, will communicate about risks,
       and is always willing to learn a new skill or tool out of a desire to constantly 
       learn or a desire to do what is needed to deliver on time, on cost and with quality.</p>
