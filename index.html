  <div style = "font-size:32px"> About Me <div>
  <p> I am an experienced Quality Engineer with 5+ years in the Automotive and Robotics industry. I started out with a B.S. in Engineering Science and Mechanics, with a minor in National Security and Foreign Affairs from Virginia Tech, and have self taught myself various skills as needed for my postion. I started as an intern with my current company and as different responsibilites were place on our team, I took the initiative to learn skills such as software administration, programming in python, developed cross tool automations, and data analysis. My personal brand is "Let Me Try." -- I am the individual who does not like to back down from a challenge, will communicate about risks, and is always willing to learn a new skill or tool out of a desire to constantly learn or a desire to do what is needed to deliver on time, on cost and with quality.</p>
